--The SQL EXISTS Operator
--The EXISTS operator is used to test for the existence of any record in a subquery.

--The EXISTS operator returns TRUE if the subquery returns one or more records.

--EXISTS Syntax
--SELECT column_name(s)
--FROM table_name
--WHERE EXISTS
--(SELECT column_name FROM table_name WHERE condition);

--The SQL EXISTS operator executes the outer SQL query if the subquery is not NULL (empty result-set).
