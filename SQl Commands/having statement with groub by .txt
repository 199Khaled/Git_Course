The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword cannot be used with aggregate functions in a direct way.

HAVING Syntax

SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);


select DepartmentID,TotalCount = count(MonthlySalary ),
       TotalSum = sum(MonthlySalary),
	   Average = Avg(MonthlySalary),
	   MinSalary = Min(MonthlySalary),
	   MaxSalary = Max(MonthlySalary)

       from Employees
	   group by DepartmentID
	   having count (MonthlySalary) > 150 -- havin is where statement on Group by.
	


-- having is filteration for Group by 
-- where is filteration for onther condition


-- aonther soluation to use having but in

select * from
